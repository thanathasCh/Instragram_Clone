# Instragram Clone
This project is still udner development. I develop this project in my freetime for learning proposses.

## Project description

This is my try-it-out project with Flutter. I decided to develop it with Instragram UI/UX, since it has many list view and layout. In that case, I could try to develop an app that has some layout complexity.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
